<h1>Questions and Answers concerning the Operating Systems Course in WS2021</h1>


<p><b>Question 14: Are the lectures recorded?</b></p>

<p>No.</p>

<p><b>Question 13: Do exchange students or Erasmus students also have to pass AlgDat before they can enroll in the Operating Systems course?</b></p>

<p>No. But you cannot register online via the HIS system. Please visit the examination office (Prüfungsamt) and enroll there into the Operating Systems course.</p>

<p><b>Question 12: Why is passing the Algorithms and Data Structures (AlgDat) course a prerequisite for enrolling into into the Operating Systems course?</b></p>

<p>Because a few years ago there were many students who postponed AlgDat (sometimes until the end of their studies) and this is not useful. AlgDat is essential for almost all modules of practical computer science and should definitely be learned at the beginning of your studies. That is why this prerequisite was established in 2016/2017.</p>

<p><b>Question 11: Is passing the Algorithms and Data Structures (AlgDat) course a prerequisite for enrolling into the Operating Systems course?</b></p>

<p>Yes. It is also specified in the <a href="https://www.frankfurt-university.de/fileadmin/standard/Studium/Studiengaenge/Fb_2/Bachelor-Studiengaenge/Informatik_B.Sc/Dokumente/MHB_BA_Informatik_2012__ASIIN_240619_.pdf">module handbook</a> of the computer science bachelor's degree program. It says on page 56:</p>

<p>
<tt>Module prerequisites Passed examination module 9: Algorithmen und Datenstrukturen</tt><br>
<tt>Module examination requirements Passed examination module 9: Algorithmen und Datenstrukturen</tt>
</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://www.frankfurt-university.de/fileadmin/standard/Studium/Studiengaenge/Fb_2/Bachelor-Studiengaenge/Informatik_-_mobile_Anwendungen/Dokumente/MHB_Ba_IMA__30.07.2019_.pdf">module handbook</a> of the  Mobile Applications bachelor's degree program, the same is written on page.</p>


<p><b>Question 10: When do the lecture and the exercise sessions start?</b></p>

<p>November 10th, 2020.</p>

<p><b>Question 9: What is the best way to learn for the exam?</b></p>

<p>Solve the exercise sheets! If you can solve the exercise sheets with your auxiliary material, you are well prepared. On the lecture page you can also find exams and sample solutions from previous years.</p>


<p><b>Question 8: Which auxiliary materials are permitted in the exam?</b></p>

<p>Each participant is allowed to use a <u>calculator</u> and to bring a <u>self prepared and handwritten</u> DIN-A4 sheet whose content is free into the exam. Attention: Only <u>a single side</u> of the DIN-A4 sheet is allowed to be used! Only handwritten originals are allowed but no copies.</p>


<p><b>Question 7: Why are the sample solutions for the exercise sheets online?</b></p>

<p>So that you can self-check your knowledge and find out where you need to improve further. If you have any questions, please use the exercise sessions to solve these questions.</p>

<p><b>Question 6: In which exercises may or must I participate?</b></p>

<p>You can participate in all exercise sessions for as long as you want. Please participate whenever you have questions, want to discuss things or if you want some feedback. You can attend the virtual exercise sessions and leave whenever you want.</p>

<p><b>Question 5: What is the password of the <img src="Bilder/zoom_communications_logo_wikipedia_cc0.png" alt="Zoom Logo" border="0" width="51" height="12"> video conferences?</b></p>

<tt>OpSys</tt>


<p><b>Question 4: How do the exercises take place in WS2021?</b></p>

<p>As <img src="Bilder/zoom_communications_logo_wikipedia_cc0.png" alt="Zoom Logo" border="0" width="51" height="12"> video conferences. The links for accessing them can be found on the <a href="index_en.html">course homepage</a>.</p>

<p><b>Question 3: How do the lectures take place in WS2021?</b></p>

<p>As <img src="Bilder/zoom_communications_logo_wikipedia_cc0.png" alt="Zoom Logo" border="0" width="51" height="12"> video conferences in English language. The links for accessing them can be found on the <a href="index_en.html">course homepage</a>.</p>

<p><b>Question 2: What is the password of the lecture notes?</b></p>

<p>There is no password.</p>
