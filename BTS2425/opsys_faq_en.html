<h1>Questions and Answers concerning the Operating Systems Course in WS2425</h1>

<!-- <p><b>Question 16: When can I do a post-exam review?</b></p> -->

<!--<p>You can come to any of my consultation hours to inspect your exam. The date of the weekly consultation hour will be announced at the beginning of the course period on my website.</p>-->

<!-- <p><b>Question 15: Which auxiliary materials are permitted in the exam?</b></p> -->

<!--<p>Each participant is allowed to use a <u>calculator</u> and to bring a <u>self prepared and handwritten</u> DIN-A4 sheet whose content is free into the exam. Attention: Only <u>a single side</u> of the DIN-A4 sheet is allowed to be used! Only handwritten originals are allowed but no copies.</p>-->


<p><b>Question 16: Is it mandatory to wear a mask in class and during the exercise sessions?</b></p>

<p>No.</p>

<p><b>Question 15: When do the lecture and the exercise sessions start?</b></p>

<!-- <p>TBD</p> -->

<p>The lecture and the exercise sessions will start on October 24th, 2024.</p>

<!-- <p>The exercise sessions start on October 24th, 2024.</p> -->

<p><b>Question 14: Will there be an exam SS2025?</b></p>

<p>In the past, there has always been an exam in summer term, and this will probably be the case in SS2025 as well.</p>

<p><b>Question 13: Are the lectures recorded?</b></p>

<p>No.</p>

<p><b>Question 12: Do exchange students or Erasmus students also have to pass AlgDat before they can enroll in the Operating Systems course?</b></p>

<p>No. But you cannot register online via the HIS system. Please visit the examination office (Prüfungsamt) and enroll there into the Operating Systems course.</p>

<p><b>Question 11: Why is passing the Algorithms and Data Structures (AlgDat) course a prerequisite for enrolling into the Operating Systems course?</b></p>

<p>Because a few years ago there were many students who postponed AlgDat (sometimes until the end of their studies) and this is not useful. AlgDat is essential for almost all modules of practical computer science and should definitely be learned at the beginning of your studies. That is why this prerequisite was established in 2016/2017.</p>

<p><b>Question 10: Is passing the Algorithms and Data Structures (AlgDat) course a prerequisite for enrolling into the Operating Systems course?</b></p>

<p>Yes. It is also specified in the <a href="https://www.frankfurt-university.de/fileadmin/standard/Studium/Studiengaenge/Fb_2/Bachelor-Studiengaenge/Informatik_B.Sc/Dokumente/MHB_BA_Informatik_2012__23.11.2022_.pdf">module handbook</a> of the computer science bachelor's degree program. It says on page 64:</p>

<p>
<tt>Module prerequisites Passed examination module 9: Algorithmen und Datenstrukturen</tt><br>
<tt>Module examination requirements Passed examination module 9: Algorithmen und Datenstrukturen</tt>
</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://www.frankfurt-university.de/fileadmin/standard/Studium/Studiengaenge/Fb_2/Bachelor-Studiengaenge/Informatik_-_mobile_Anwendungen/Dokumente/MHB_Ba_IMA__30.07.2019_.pdf">module handbook</a> of the  Mobile Applications bachelor's degree program, the same is written on page 65.</p>


<p><b>Question 9: Is a UNIX-like operating system required for solving the Linux and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/">Bash</a> exercise questions?</b></p>

<p>In Linux and other UNIX-like operating systems, the Bash is always included.</p>

<p>In MacOS, Bash was the default shell for 15 years. Since MacOS 10.15 (Catalina), MacOS uses ZSH as the default shell. For the vast majority of Bash exercise questions in this course, however, this makes no difference. You can also switch to Bash at any time. With the help of a search engine you can find countless instructions/tutorials. Some examples:</p>

</ul>

<p>In Windows, you can reinstall Bash easily since a few years. With the help of a search engine you can find countless installation tutorials. Some examples:</p>

</ul>

<p><b>Question 8: What is the best way to learn for the exam?</b></p>

<p>Solve the exercise sheets! If you can solve the exercise sheets with your auxiliary material, you are well prepared. The course page also provides exams and sample solutions from previous years.</p>

<p><b>Question 7: Is it allowed to use different colors and write very small on the auxiliary material?</b></p>

<p>Sure. If that helps you.</p>

<p><b>Question 6: Is it allowed to create and print the auxiliary material with a computer?</b></p>

<p>No.</p>


<p><b>Question 5: Is it allowed to inscribe the auxiliary material on both sides?</b></p>

<p>No.</p>

<p><b>Question 4: Which auxiliary materials are permitted in the exam?</b></p>

<p>Each participant is allowed to use a <u>calculator</u> and to bring a <u>self prepared and handwritten</u> DIN-A4 sheet whose content is free into the exam. Attention: Only <u>a single side</u> of the DIN-A4 sheet is allowed to be used! Only handwritten originals are allowed but no copies.</p>


<p><b>Question 3: Why are the sample solutions for the exercise sheets online?</b></p>

<p>So that you can self-check your knowledge and find out where you need to improve further. If you have any questions, please use the exercise sessions to solve these questions.</p>

<p><b>Question 2: In which exercises may or must I participate?</b></p>

<p>You can participate in all exercise sessions for as long as you want. Please participate whenever you have questions, want to discuss things or if you want some feedback. You can attend the exercise sessions and leave whenever you want.</p>

<p><b>Question 1: What is the password of the lecture notes?</b></p>

<p>There is no password.</p>

<!-- <p><b>Question 1: Will there be any class or exercise sessions in presence in WS2324?</b></p> -->

<!-- <p>Yes! The lecture and the practical exercises will take place at the university in presence.</p> -->
