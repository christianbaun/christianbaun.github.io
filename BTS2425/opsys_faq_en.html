<h1>Questions and Answers concerning the Operating Systems Course in WS2425</h1>


<ol>

<li><strong> What is the password of the lecture notes/course material?</strong>

<p>There is no password.</p>
</li>    

<li><strong>There is a lot of material for the lecture and exercises. What is the best way to pass the module?</strong>

<p>On the <a href="index_en.html">website</a> of the module, you will find the semester schedule. This schedule is continuously updated, providing you with information on individual dates and all lecture documents. This ongoing update allows you to stay informed about what content was discussed in the lecture and what will be discussed in the next lecture, helping you to prepare accordingly. </p>

<p>There are exercise sheets for the topics of the slide sets, which repeat the most important content of the respective slide sets. You should be able to solve the exercise sheets independently with the help of the slide sets. You can do this in the practice sessions or at any other time and place. For a few exercises, you will need to do some research. The sample solutions to the exercise sheets are online for checking purposes. The tutors and I will help you with questions during the practice sessions. If you have any urgent questions or other problems, please do not hesitate to <a href="mailto:christianbaun@fb2.fra-uas.de">contact me</a>.</p>

<p>The examination at the end of the semester is a written exam lasting 90 minutes. Exams from previous semesters and the corresponding sample solutions can be found on the <a href="index_en.html">website</a> of the module. The contents of the slide sets discussed during the semester and, thus, primarily, the corresponding exercise sheets are relevant for the exam. The written exam will include tasks from each exercise sheet covered in the content.

<p>Traditionally, I allow one resource for my exams (see questions 16-21) with clearly defined rules. Prepare your resource carefully and try to solve the exercise sheets and some old exams with your resource at the end of the lecture period. If you succeed, you will be well prepared for the exam.

<p>Even if it clashes with the reality of life from time to time, I strongly recommend attending the lecture regularly. If you attend the lecture regularly, you will spend about 90 minutes a week on the lecture content, get questions, answers, and discussions, and can ask questions yourself. This adds up to a lot of time over the semester (15 weeks &times; 90 minutes = 22.5 hours) and catching up on your own requires a lot of self-discipline. My advice: If you can attend the lecture, then go!
</li>     

<li><strong>When do the lecture and the exercise sessions start?</strong>

<!-- <p>TBD</p> -->

<p>The lecture and the exercise sessions will start on October 24th, 2024.</p>

</li>

<li><strong>Is it mandatory to wear a mask in class and during the exercise sessions?</strong>

<p>No.</p>
</li>    

<li><strong>Do I need a mask in a class or in the exercise sessions if I am ill?</strong>

<p>If you are ill, please stay at home and get well.</p>
</li>    

<li><strong>Will there be an exam in summer term?</strong>

<p>In the past, there has always been an exam in the following summer term, and this will probably be the case in SS2025 as well.</p>
</li>    

<li><strong>Will the exam in the summer term be easier or harder?</strong>

<p>No. The exam will be neither easier nor more difficult.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Are the lectures recorded?</strong>

<p>No.</p>
</li>    

<li><strong>Why are the sample solutions for the exercise sheets online?</strong>

<p>So that you can self-check your knowledge and find out where you need to improve further. If you have any questions, please use the exercise sessions to solve these questions.</p>
</li>    

<li><strong>In which exercises may or must I participate?</strong>

<p>You can participate in all exercise sessions for as long as you want. Please participate whenever you have questions, want to discuss things or if you want some feedback. <!--You can attend the virtual exercise sessions and leave whenever you want.--></p>
</li>

<li><strong>Is passing the Algorithms and Data Structures (AlgDat) course a prerequisite for enrolling into the Operating Systems course?</strong>

<p>Yes. It is also specified in the <a href="https://www.frankfurt-university.de/fileadmin/standard/Studium/Studiengaenge/Fb_2/Bachelor-Studiengaenge/Informatik_B.Sc/Dokumente/MHB_BA_Informatik_2012__23.11.2022_.pdf">module handbook</a> of the computer science bachelor's degree program. It says on page 64:</p>

<p>
<tt>Module prerequisites Passed examination module 9: Algorithmen und Datenstrukturen</tt><br>
<tt>Module examination requirements Passed examination module 9: Algorithmen und Datenstrukturen</tt>
</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://www.frankfurt-university.de/fileadmin/standard/Studium/Studiengaenge/Fb_2/Bachelor-Studiengaenge/Informatik_-_mobile_Anwendungen/Dokumente/MHB_Ba_IMA__30.07.2019_.pdf">module handbook</a> of the  Mobile Applications bachelor's degree program, the same is written on page 65.</p>

</li>

<li><strong>Why is passing the Algorithms and Data Structures (AlgDat) course a prerequisite for enrolling into the Operating Systems course?</strong>

<p>Because a few years ago there were many students who postponed AlgDat (sometimes until the end of their studies) and this is not useful. AlgDat is essential for almost all modules of practical computer science and should definitely be learned at the beginning of your studies. That is why this prerequisite was established in 2016/2017.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Do exchange students or Erasmus students also have to pass AlgDat before they can enroll in the Operating Systems course?</strong>

<p>No. But you cannot register online via the HIS system. Please visit the examination office (Prüfungsamt) and enroll there into the Operating Systems course.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Is a UNIX-like operating system required for solving the Linux and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/">Bash</a> exercise questions?</strong>

<p>In Linux and other UNIX-like operating systems, the Bash is always included.</p>

<p>In MacOS, Bash was the default shell for 15 years. Since MacOS 10.15 (Catalina), MacOS uses ZSH as the default shell. For the vast majority of Bash exercise questions in this course, however, this makes no difference. You can also switch to Bash at any time. With the help of a search engine you can find countless instructions/tutorials.</p>

<p>In Windows, you can reinstall Bash easily since a few years. With the help of a search engine you can find countless installation tutorials.</p>
</li>


<li><strong>What is the best way to learn for the exam?</strong>

<p>Solve the exercise sheets! If you can solve the exercise sheets with your auxiliary material, you are well prepared. The course page also provides exams and sample solutions from previous years.</p>
</li>    



<li><strong> Which auxiliary materials are permitted in the exam?</strong>

<p>Each participant is allowed to use a <u>calculator</u> and to bring a <u>self prepared and handwritten</u> DIN-A4 sheet whose content is free into the exam. Attention: Only <u>a single side</u> of the DIN-A4 sheet is allowed to be used! Only handwritten originals are allowed but no copies.</p>
</li>    

<li><strong> Is it allowed to inscribe the auxiliary material on both sides?</strong>

<p>No.</p>
</li>    


<li><strong> Is it allowed to create and print the auxiliary material with a computer?</strong>

<p>No.</p>
</li>    



<li><strong>Is it allowed to use a tablet computer in the exam as auxiliary material if the auxiliary material was written there with a tablet pen?</strong>

<p>No. Only real (analog) paper is permitted in the exam.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Is it allowed to use different colors and write very small on the auxiliary material?</strong>

<p>Sure. If that helps you.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Is it allowed to bring a magnifying glass to the exam?</strong>

<p>Sure. If that helps you.</p>

</li>    


<!--<li><strong> 1: Will there be any class or exercise sessions in presence in WS2425?</strong>

<p>Yes, the lectures and exercises will be held at the university.</p>-->
