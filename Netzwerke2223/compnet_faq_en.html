<h1>Questions and answers concerning the Computer Networks course in WS2223</h1>

<p><b>Question 15: Is it mandatory to wear a mask in class and during the exercise sessions?</b></p>

<p>This has not yet been determined (as of September 14th, 2022).</p>

<p><b>Question 13: Will there be an exam SS2023?</b></p>

<p>In the past, there has always been an exam in the following semester, and this will probably be the case in SS2023 as well.</p>

<p><b>Question 12: Are the lectures recorded?</b></p>

<p>No.</p>


<p><b>Question 11: Why are there no practical exercises on computer networks in this module?</b></p>

<p>For this purpose there is the module <b>Practical Computer Networks and Applications</b> in the summer term.</p>

<p><b>Question 10: What happened to the computer networks lab?</b></p>

<p>Since 2019, the computer networks lab is a separate module (<b>Practical Computer Networks and Applications</b>) in the summer term.</p>

<p><b>Question 9: What is the best way to learn for the exam?</b></p>

<p>Solve the exercise sheets! If you can solve the exercise sheets with your auxiliary material, you are well prepared. The course page also provides exams and sample solutions from previous years.</p>

<p><b>Question 8: Is it allowed to use different colors and write very small on the auxiliary material?</b></p>

<p>Sure. If that helps you.</p>

<p><b>Question 7: Is it allowed to create and print the auxiliary material with a computer?</b></p>

<p>No.</p>

<p><b>Question 6: Is it allowed to inscribe the auxiliary material on both sides?</b></p>

<p>No.</p>

<p><b>Question 5: Which auxiliary materials are permitted in the exam?</b></p>

<p>Each participant is allowed to use a <u>calculator</u> and to bring a <u>self prepared and handwritten</u> DIN-A4 sheet whose content is free into the exam. Attention: Only <u>a single side</u> of the DIN-A4 sheet is allowed to be used! Only handwritten originals are allowed but no copies.</p>

<p><b>Question 4: Why are the sample solutions for the exercise sheets online?</b></p>

<p>So that you can self-check your knowledge and find out where you need to improve further. If you have any questions, please use the exercise sessions to solve these questions.</p>

<p><b>Question 3: In which exercises may or must I participate?</b></p>

<p>You can participate in all exercise sessions for as long as you want. Please participate whenever you have questions, want to discuss things or if you want some feedback. <!--You can attend the virtual exercise sessions and leave whenever you want.--></p>


<p><b>Question 2: What is the password of the lecture notes?</b></p>

<p>There is no password.</p>

<p><b>Question 1: Will there be any class or exercise sessions in presence in WS2223?</b></p>

<p>Yes, the lectures and exercises will be held at the university. Should the pandemic situation require a reorganization, we will switch back to online teaching in the short term. So far, however, this is not foreseeable.</p>
